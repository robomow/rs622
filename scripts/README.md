# rs622 - Scripts directory contains useful shell scripts that contain the commands and arguments to run the opencv training programs to create pos and negative images, to train the cascade, to call the custom python programs we have written to detect the robomow.

# annotate-pos-images.sh - Runs opencv_annotate to load and display some custom positive images I captured that have no background and only contain my robomow.
